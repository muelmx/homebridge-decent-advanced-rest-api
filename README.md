# Decent DE1 Homebridge Advanced Rest Api Plugin

made to work with https://github.com/randomcoffeesnob/decent-advanced-rest-api


## Configuration

The `waterTankSize` attribute is used to calculate the water tank level depending on the amount of water you usually fill it up with.

The individual temperature / water level sensors can be disabled by setting the respective flags to true (see _full config_). If you are using automations based on room temperature / humidity it is recommended to disable the sensors.
